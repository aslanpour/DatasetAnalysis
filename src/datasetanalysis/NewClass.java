/*
 * This project analyzes the Milano Weather Station Data. 
 * This data contains the information about the temperature and relative humidity gathered 
 * during around 2 months in 2013 in Milano, Lambrate street.
 * 1) We 1) analyze the distribution of the data (temperature and relative humidity) 
 * in terms of its centrality and shape, 
 * 2) try to find a relationship between temperature and relative humidity using regression, 
 * and 3) propose a prediction method for this purpose based on artificial neural networks.
